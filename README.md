Advanced Semantic Keyword Clustering
A powerful tool for clustering keywords based on semantic similarity, search intent analysis, and customer journey mapping.

Semantic Clustering: Group keywords by meaning, not just lexical similarity
Search Intent Analysis: Classify keywords into informational, navigational, transactional, and commercial intents
Customer Journey Mapping: Understand which stage of the customer journey your clusters represent
Multi-language Support: Process keywords in English, Spanish, French, German, Polish and more
Interactive Visualizations: Explore your keyword clusters with intuitive charts and graphs
Export Options: Download results as CSV, Excel, JSON, or comprehensive PDF reports
AI-Powered Analysis: Get intelligent recommendations for content planning (OpenAI API optional)

Usage Guide

Upload Your Keywords:

Upload a CSV file with keywords
Choose either "No Header" (one keyword per line) or "With Header" (Keyword Planner format)


Configure Clustering:

Set the number of clusters
Adjust PCA variance for dimensionality reduction
Specify your preferred language


Optional: Add OpenAI API Key:

For enhanced embeddings and cluster naming
Estimate costs with the built-in calculator


Launch the Clustering Process:

Click the "Start Advanced Semantic Clustering" button
Watch as your keywords are processed and analyzed


Explore Results:

Visualize cluster sizes and coherence
Analyze search intent distribution
Map keywords to customer journey phases
View detailed cluster contents


Export Your Data:

Download as CSV, Excel, JSON, or comprehensive PDF report
Share insights with your team



CSV Format Options
The tool accepts two CSV formats:
1. No Header Format (Simple)
running shoes
nike shoes
adidas sneakers
2. With Header Format (Keyword Planner style)
Keyword,search_volume,competition,cpc
running shoes,5400,0.75,1.25
nike shoes,8900,0.82,1.78
adidas sneakers,3200,0.65,1.12
Search Intent Categories
Keywords are classified into four intent categories:

Informational: Users seeking information or answers (e.g., "how to", "what is")
Navigational: Users looking for a specific website or page (e.g., brand names, login pages)
Transactional: Users ready to make a purchase (e.g., "buy", "discount", "shop")
Commercial: Users researching before purchasing (e.g., "best", "reviews", "vs")

Customer Journey Analysis
The tool maps keyword clusters to stages in the customer journey:

Early Phase (Research): Dominated by informational queries
Middle Phase (Consideration): Primarily commercial comparison queries
Late Phase (Purchase): Mostly transactional buying queries

Advanced Configuration
For more control, edit these parameters:
python# In semantic_clustering/app.py
NUM_CLUSTERS = 10  # Default number of clusters
PCA_VARIANCE = 95  # Default PCA explained variance percentage
MAX_PCA_COMPONENTS = 100  # Maximum PCA components
